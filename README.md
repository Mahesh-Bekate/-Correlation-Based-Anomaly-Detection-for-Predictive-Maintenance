# -Correlation-Based-Anomaly-Detection-for-Predictive-Maintenance

This repository contains the project where I implemented a research paper on correlation-based anomaly detection for predictive maintenance. I have used the open source MAFAULDA vibration dataset which contains vibration data for a rotating machine in  normal conditon and when subjected to 5 different faults types. I have used the imbalance fault type in the project to detect anomalies. The main idea is to leverage the correlation between two sensors as an anomaly could cause a change in the patterns of the correlation coefficients between the two sensors.
